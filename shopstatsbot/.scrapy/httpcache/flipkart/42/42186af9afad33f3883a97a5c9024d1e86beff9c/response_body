Powered by Intel Core i5 processor, this Sony notebook gives a smooth and immersive experience. The VAIO budget-friendly laptop is preloaded with Windows 7 Home Premium operating system. Style and Portability The lightweight design and attractive chassis make this ultra-portable entertainment laptop stand out in a crowd. VAIO C Series is fashioned to brighten up your life with premium design in vivid colour based on a new light-emitting material. The exterior and interior panels are made of glossy translucent plastic which scatters light along edges of the opening lid and other key surfaces to create a dramatic glow effect. The full-pitch isolation keyboard with 82 keys and 19.05 mm key pitch is made from soft-touch plastic and it allows speedy and accurate touch-typing. The backlit feature lights up the keyboard when it is used in dark places. The audacious design of the multi-touch textured touchpad adds more beauty to this laptop. The 14 inch VAIO Display screen with LED backlighting provides plenty of screen space for web browsing, photo viewing and document editing. The display has 1366 x 768 pixels resolution and cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio.

300V5A-S08IN Laptop (2nd Gen Ci7/ 6GB/ 640GB/ Win7 HP/ 1GB Graph)","productDescription":"Samsung comes up trumps with its new addition to the Series 3 Line of high-performance laptops. The 300V5A-S08IN laptop is crafted to meet your requirements in terms of entertainment, business and more. The notebook comes powered by an Intel Core i7 processor and works on Windows 7 Home Premium, an easy-to-use interface that suits both beginners and professionals. Style and Portability When it comes to looks and style, the laptop ranks among the best in the business as it personifies class and elegance in all its glory. The notebook comes with a pleasing cosmetic appeal due to its gleaming metallic finish. The exterior looks ultra-chic and also boasts of great strength and durability. The portability quotient of this device is surprisingly good for a large device as it weighs only 2.45 kg. You can easily slip the notebook into your backpack, thanks largely to its sleek dimensions of 366.9 x 240.0 x 31.6 mm. Cast in a slim frame, the 15.6 inch screen of the Samsung Series 3 notebook is large and ideal for watching movies as it offers nice viewing angles for your convenience. The LED HD Display delivers sharp and clear images at a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. The laptop maximizes the screen and reduces the bezel to give you a better viewing experience. Comfort is what the interiors strive to give you and they end up giving you loads of that. The Island style keyboard consists of a set of large, flat keys to help you type with better speed and accuracy. Navigating through web pages is as effortless as it can get as the touch scroll pad offers smooth feedback. Performance Get ready to work with amazing processing speeds, courtesy of the powerful 2nd Generation Intel Core i7 2670QM processor which comes built on an Intel HM65 chipset.
