Alienware laptops are well known for their immense power, superior graphics handling capabilities and also for their processor choices. Alienware products are also designed well, primarily focusing on a futuristic and out-of-this-world look for their machines. Game Console with Brains You could consider the Alienware laptop to be like a game console primarily, though with all the other parts that it comes with, it is clearly a laptop of the highest caliber. Shipping with a Core i7 processor that clocks in at 2.7 GHz without Turbo Boost and 3.7 with it. With such a lot of power under the hood, it should come as no surprise that it can handle most, if not all games with relative ease. Apart from gaming alone, the speedy processor also allows for some serious number crunching thanks to the blazing fast clock speeds. A beefy processor alone will not cut it when high performance gaming is desired. For this, you will need ample RAM as well. The Dell Alienware laptop comes with 16 GB of DDR3 RAM preinstalled. With so much of available RAM it is a given that multitasking will be a breeze on the device. Graphical Prowess In terms of graphics, the Alienware is perfectly at home even with visually intensive games and tasks. The onboard NVIDIA GTX 765M from the GeForce range of cards is more than capable of handling most if not all the major titles available in the market today. The laptop also comes with a high definition display with LED and Anti-Glare to cut down on reflections and glare during gameplay. Sound and More As a gaming laptop, it is always assumed that players will go for high quality headsets for quality sound. If you just happen to not possess a set, you can still enjoy quality sound thanks to the built-in stereo speakers with a 5.1 setup. You get Performance Audio Quality with Dolby Home Theatre v4 that can enhance the sound quality to dizzying heights.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/f/9/h/dell-alienware-14-notebook-400x400-imadnx2xfkgcrnmj.jpeg","275x275":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/f/9/h/dell-alienware-14-notebook-275x275-imadnx2xfkgcrnmj.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/f/9/h/dell-alienware-14-notebook-75x75-imadnx2xfkgcrnmj.jpeg","125x125":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/f/9/h/dell-alienware-14-notebook-125x125-imadnx2xfkgcrnmj.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/computer/f/9/h/dell-alienware-14-notebook-40x40-imadnx2xfkgcrnmj.jpeg","1100x1100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/f/9/h/dell-alienware-14-notebook-1100x1100-imadnx2xfkgcrnmj.jpeg","100x100":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/computer/f/9/h/dell-alienware-14-notebook-100x100-imadnx2xfkgcrnmj.jpeg","200x200":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/computer/f/9/h/dell-alienware-14-notebook-200x200-imadnx2xfkgcrnmj.jpeg","unknown":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/computer/f/9/h/dell-alienware-14-notebook-original-imadnx2xfkgcrnmj.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":151990.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":151990.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/alienware-14-aw147167502a-core-i7-16-gb-ddr3-750-hdd-windows-8-2-graphics-notebook/p/itmdnx2rrdtckysc?pid=COMDNX2ZVJ8XUF9H&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"ALIENWARE","inStock":false,"codAvailable":false,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":0.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Anodized

The Inspiron series of laptops by Dell are more popular among students, professionals and casual users alike. This is mainly because they are designed to be versatile and user friendly across user bases. Performance Hog The Dell Inspiron Laptop is highly capable of rapid performance outputs thanks to its capable Core i3 Processor that clocks in at 1.9 GHz. This speed is more than enough to carry it through most tasks that are CPU intensive with relative ease. Coupled with 4 GB of RAM which is expandable, you could easily use the device for some serious multitasking. Build Quality The laptop is well built as you would expect from a quintessential entertainment system and it comes with a textured outer surface that not only makes it look premium and versatile, it also makes it easy to grip it while carrying it from one place to another. The textured surface also helps in eliminating any fingerprints from sticking onto the surface. When you open the laptop you also notice that the palm rests are ample and spacious.

This can range from simple office work, Spreadsheet short cut entry, light gaming sessions to even full blown entertainment sessions that involve a lot of movie watching or music sessions. Keeping this in mind, the manufacturers have made sure that the keyboard included a dedicated number pad as well. This is highly useful for gaming as well as for office work.
