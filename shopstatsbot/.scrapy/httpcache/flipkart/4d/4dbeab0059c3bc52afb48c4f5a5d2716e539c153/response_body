PowerShot A4000 IS Point & Shoot Camera","productDescription":"From Canon’s highly successful series of PowerShot digital cameras is the vastly capable PowerShot A4000 IS. This advanced point and shoot digital camera is the ideal choice for hobbyists or amateur photographers looking to extend the utility of their compact digital camera. Featuring a number of pre-set shooting modes along with automatic picture adjustment functions, this Canon PowerShot is also ideal for capturing and immortalising those rare, unforgettable or candid moments. With a focal length of 5 to 40 mm or a 35 mm equivalent of 28 – 224 mm, the PowerShot A4000 IS offers levels of optical and digital zoom functions. The availability of an 8x optical zoom for clear and considerable magnification along with a 4x digital for further enlargement of the picture, gives the A4000 IS a greater scope for usage in areas like outdoor or landscape photography. The CCD sensor in this Canon PowerShot allows you to capture images at an incredible 16 megapixel resolution. The A4000 IS features a compact body with a strong yet light metal body that weighs in at just 130 g and a very modest 145 g with the inclusion of the battery and memory card. This metal body gives the camera a great deal of durability and portability. The back panel of the A4000 IS houses a sizable 3 inch TFT colour screen with wide viewing angle and 5 levels of brightness adjustment levels for increased user personalisation. This LCD display has an astonishing resolution of approximately 230,000 dots with a 4:3 aspect ratio. Just to the right of the display screen are the well-spaced and neatly arranged menu navigation buttons. The 16 megapixel sensor when combined with a highly advanced Digic 4 processor makes it possible for the PowerShot A4000 IS to shoot images at a maximum resolution of 4608 x 3456 pixels. It can further record HD videos at a resolution of 1280 x 720 at 25 frames per second and is saved in the MOV or H.264 file format. Also featured is a mono microphone for capturing clear 2 channel audio when recording video. Battery and Storage The A4000 IS from Canon features an SD memory card slot that houses the camera's recording medium, which could be an SD card, SDHC card or SDXC memory card with a maximum memory of 32 GB. You can also transfer images or videos from the camera to a PC using the high-speed USB 2.0 port or through a memory card reader. This connection with a computer is made easier with the camera's compatibility with Windows and Mac operating systems including Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP and MAC OS X 10.   Performance The aperture control of this PowerShot has a range of f/3.0 to f/9.0 (wide) and f/5.9 to f/18 (tele) which gives you considerable control over how much light passes through the lens. The A4000 IS uses a TTL or through-the-lens optical auto focus sensor which is quicker and more precise than when done manually. This auto focus ranges from 10 mm (Wide) and 1000 mm (Tele) to infinity, while in macro mode is from 10 mm to 500 mm. The camera’s light sensitivity can further be controlled through variable ISO settings which range from ISO 100 all the way to ISO 1600. The shutter speed of this Canon A4000 IS a ranges from 1 tio 1/2000 sec on auto mode and 15 to 1/2000 sec while operating in the manual shooting mode. The built-in flash has a range of 500 - 3000 mm (Wide) and 1000 - 2000 (Tele), which lets you take quality images even under poor lighting conditions. The inclusion of various flash modes including auto, on, slow sync and off increases the usability of the flash while capturing images. Also available on the Canon PowerShot is the option of white balancing that has both auto and manual modes to increase the effectiveness of the image or video. Features This PowerShot camera lets you capture the world around you through a wide variety of 32 pre-set shooting modes like portrait, monochrome, discreet, snow and fireworks. The advent of a lens-shift type image stabilization prevents blurring of images. Adding to the abundance of features on the A4000 IS is the self timer and the continuous shot mode. The discreet mode is a great feature that cancels the electronic shutter sound, making the camera usable in places where extra light and sound are not be welcomed like in museums or a theatre.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/p/f/b/canon-powershot-a4000-is-point-shoot-400x400-imad8yzc3hh49cwe.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/p/f/b/canon-powershot-a4000-is-point-shoot-75x75-imad8yzc3hh49cwe.jpeg","275x275":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/p/f/b/canon-powershot-a4000-is-point-shoot-275x275-imad8yzc3hh49cwe.jpeg","125x125":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/p/f/b/canon-powershot-a4000-is-point-shoot-125x125-imad8yzc3hh49cwe.jpeg","40x40":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/p/f/b/canon-powershot-a4000-is-point-shoot-40x40-imad8yzc3hh49cwe.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/p/f/b/canon-powershot-a4000-is-point-shoot-100x100-imad8yzc3hh49cwe.jpeg","200x200":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/p/f/b/canon-powershot-a4000-is-point-shoot-200x200-imad8yzc3hh49cwe.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/p/f/b/canon-powershot-a4000-is-point-shoot-original-imad8yzc3hh49cwe.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":8495.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":8070.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/canon-powershot-a4000-point-shoot-camera/p/itmd8yvyjtw9gfcz?pid=CAMD8YVYFJRJCPFB&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Canon","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":5.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Black","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[CAMD8CB3FEBQTWDW,

You can also capture fast moving objects or actions sequentially with the Continuous mode, which clicks 1.2 fps with a maximum of 3 frames.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/g/z/n/fujifilm-finepix-jv-150-point-shoot-400x400-imacyy2kzbhfhpw8.jpeg","275x275":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/g/z/n/fujifilm-finepix-jv-150-point-shoot-275x275-imacyy2kzbhfhpw8.jpeg","75x75":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/g/z/n/fujifilm-finepix-jv-150-point-shoot-75x75-imacyy2kzbhfhpw8.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/g/z/n/fujifilm-finepix-jv-150-point-shoot-125x125-imacyy2kzbhfhpw8.jpeg","40x40":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/g/z/n/fujifilm-finepix-jv-150-point-shoot-40x40-imacyy2kzbhfhpw8.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/g/z/n/fujifilm-finepix-jv-150-point-shoot-100x100-imacyy2kzbhfhpw8.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/g/z/n/fujifilm-finepix-jv-150-point-shoot-200x200-imacyy2kzbhfhpw8.jpeg","unknown":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/g/z/n/fujifilm-finepix-jv-150-point-shoot-original-imacyy2kzbhfhpw8.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":8999.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":5985.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/fujifilm-finepix-jv-150-point-shoot-camera/p/itmcuts2qtgypk8f?pid=CAMCUTTND6YJXGZN&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Fujifilm","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":33.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Silver","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[CAMCUTS2QTGYPK8F]","colorVariants":"[CAMCUTS2QTGYPK8F]","styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAME5HZZYCUPUAHC","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Pentax K 50 (DA 18 - 135 mm F3.5 - 5.6 AL WR) DSLR Camera","productDescription":null,"imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/a/h/c/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-400x400-imae5kq5zjbbyvat.jpeg","75x75":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/a/h/c/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-75x75-imae5kq5zjbbyvat.jpeg","275x275":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/a/h/c/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-275x275-imae5kq5zjbbyvat.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/a/h/c/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-125x125-imae5kq5zjbbyvat.jpeg","40x40":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/a/h/c/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-40x40-imae5kq5zjbbyvat.jpeg","1100x1100":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/a/h/c/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-1100x1100-imae5kq5zjbbyvat.jpeg","100x100":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/a/h/c/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-100x100-imae5kq5zjbbyvat.jpeg","200x200":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/a/h/c/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-200x200-imae5kq5zjbbyvat.jpeg","unknown":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/a/h/c/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-original-imae5kq5zjbbyvat.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":73455.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":73455.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/pentax-k-50-da-18-135-mm-f3-5-5-6-al-wr-dslr-camera/p/itme5hpybunudghf?pid=CAME5HZZYCUPUAHC&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Pentax","inStock":false,"codAvailable":false,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":0.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Red","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAMCWHN8VBFKGB8V","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Samsung PL210 Point & Shoot Camera","productDescription":"The Samsung PL210 belongs to the PL series of point and shoot cameras from Samsung.

This A-series PowerShot camera from Canon features a 28 mm wide angle lens with a primary (RGB) colour filter and a focal length of 5 mm to 25 mm or a 35 mm equivalent of 28 mm to 140 mm. This wide angle lens has a 5x optical zoom with the availability of 4x digital zoom, which combine to give the camera a whooping 20x of zooming ability. The CCD sensor on this Canon PowerShot allows the user to capture images at an incredibly high 16 megapixel resolution. The PowerShot A2300 features a body design that weighs in at a very modest 125 g which includes the battery and memory card. The compact size, strong build and light weight components provide the A2300 with increased durability and portability. The back panel of the A2300 houses a 2.7 inch wide angle TFT colour display with 5 levels of brightness adjustment levels for increased customization. This LCD screen has a display resolution of 230,000 dots with an aspect ratio of 4:3. The 16 megapixel camera when combined with Canon’s highly advanced Digic 4 processor makes it possible for the PowerShot A2300 to record HD video at a resolution of 1280 x 720 at 25 frames per second. Battery and Storage The advent of an NB-11L rechargeable lithium-ion battery powers the Canon A2300 for up to 210 shots on full charge. All the recorded video and captured images are stored in the camera’s recording media which is in the form of an SD, SDHC or SDXC memory card. These saved files on the memory card can easily be transferred to a PC or a laptop via the camera’s high-speed USB 2.0 port, which is compatible with latest versions of Windows and Mac operating systems.

Powerflex 210-HD Point & Shoot Camera","productDescription":"As part of Powerflex series of digital cameras from Rollei comes the 210-HD Bridge camera. A bridge camera is a type of camera that finds middle ground between a point-and-shoot and a DSLR camera. This makes the 210-HD an ideal choice for those looking to make an informed and gradual transition from a compact digital camera to a DSLR. It is also a very sensible choice for those looking to get as close to a DSLR as possible without having to spend a great deal of money. A common feature among most bridge cameras is the availability of long range zoom lenses, and the Powerflex 210-HD certainly doesn’t disappoint in that aspect. With an operational focal length of 4.5 to 94.5 mm or a 35 mm equivalent of 25 – 525 mm, this Rollei 210-HD offers very advanced levels of optical and digital zoom functions. Featuring a mind-blowing 21x optical zoom along with 5x of digital zoom, this Rollei bridge camera gives you unprecedented magnification. This superior zooming ability along with the camera’s CCD image sensor lets you capture images at an amazing 16 megapixel resolution. This gives the Rollei 210-HD the ability to record high quality videos with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels at 30 fps. As with the design of most bridge cameras, the 210-HD is closely comparable to a standard or a basic DSLR in shape and size, managing to weigh 355 g which is excluding the batteries and memory card. The back panel of this Rollei bridge camera sports a 3 inch LCD colour display. Apart from letting you view the images from memory, this LCD screen also doubles as a live-viewfinder, thus compensating for the absence of an optical viewfinder. Battery and Storage The 210-HD from Rollei features an inbuilt memory of 128 MB which helps to speed up the camera’s operations and the image processing time. But the camera’s main memory storage device comes in the form of an SD, SDHC or SDXC memory card that is upgradable up to 64 GB. This Rollei bridge camera gets its power from 4 disposable or rechargeable AA alkaline batteries. Performance The aperture control lets you adjust the amount of light that falls on the image sensor, which on this Rollei ranges from f/1:3.1 - f/5.8. Featuring an autofocus function with a range that spans from 100 cm (Wide) and 150 cm (Tele) to infinity, the 210-HD also has macro focus capability. The light sensitivity of this Rollei bridge camera is from ISO 100 to 6400, which lets you take clear high quality images even under insufficient light. The camera also features a wide range of adjustable shutter speeds to help you achieve your desired result. The 210-HD operates with a maximum shutter speed of 1/2000 sec to a minimum of 15 sec. The low light capability of this camera is further increased with the integration of an inbuilt pop-up flash. This can be used in various pre-set flash modes that include Auto, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Sync, Forced On and Forced Off. Using the camera’s high-speed USB 2.0 port, the files recorded on the memory card can easily be transferred to a PC or a laptop. It also features an analog audio/video output, capable of transmitting both PAL and NTSC signals. Features The Face Detection function identifies and locks-on to the faces within the frame, so it can give priority to the clarity of the faces and not to the other low priority elements. To further tweak the feel and temperature of the image, there are  pre-set white balancing settings that include Auto, Incandescent, Fluorescent, , Daylight, Cloudy and Custom for you to choose from. The self-timer function on the Powerflex 210-HD lets you delay the shutter release by 2 or 10 seconds, making self-portraits or group shots extremely fun and convenient.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/w/b/w/rollei-powerflex-210-hd-point-shoot-400x400-imadf3g8ejpfmhca.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/w/b/w/rollei-powerflex-210-hd-point-shoot-75x75-imadf3g8ejpfmhca.jpeg","275x275":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/w/b/w/rollei-powerflex-210-hd-point-shoot-275x275-imadf3g8ejpfmhca.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/w/b/w/rollei-powerflex-210-hd-point-shoot-125x125-imadf3g8ejpfmhca.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/w/b/w/rollei-powerflex-210-hd-point-shoot-40x40-imadf3g8ejpfmhca.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/w/b/w/rollei-powerflex-210-hd-point-shoot-100x100-imadf3g8ejpfmhca.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/w/b/w/rollei-powerflex-210-hd-point-shoot-200x200-imadf3g8ejpfmhca.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/w/b/w/rollei-powerflex-210-hd-point-shoot-original-imadf3g8ejpfmhca.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":19990.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":11990.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/rollei-powerflex-210-hd-point-shoot-camera/p/itmd8h8ypdazhpbk?pid=CAMD8H8WGY9TGWBW&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Rollei","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":40.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Red","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAMDAHZ7EYVCVDU8","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Sony

FinePix AX500 Point & Shoot Camera","productDescription":"From Fujifilm’s popular A-series comes the FinePix AX500 point-and-shoot digital camera, which has all the necessary features and functions to transform the concept of digital photography into a very affordable, easy and convenient possibility. This makes the entry-level AX500 a perfect choice for those looking to start from the very basics in digital photography. This Fujifilm point and shoot digital camera features a Fujinon lens with a focal length of 5.9 - 29.5mm or 35 mm equivalent of 33 – 165 mm. Featuring a 5x optical zoom and an additional 6.7x of digital zoom, the AX500 is capable of considerable levels of overall magnification. The advent of a very capable CCD image sensor with a primary colour filter gives this digital camera a brilliant resolution of 14 megapixels. With a total weight of 168 g which includes the batteries and the memory card, this Fujifilm camera becomes increasingly portable and easy to carry around, even in the comfort of your pocket. The 14 megapixel resolution along with the CCD image sensor gives this camera the ability to record HD videos with 1280 x 720 resolution at 30 fps with monaural sound capture with both PAL and NTSC output options. These high resolution images and videos can be viewed on the FinePix AX500’s 2.7 inch colour display that boasts a display resolution of 230,000 dots. This LCD colour display also doubles as a live viewfinder as this Fujifilm camera does not come with an optical viewfinder. Battery and Storage This Fujifilm FinePix is powered either by 2 AA alkaline batteries or 2 AA Ni-MH (Nickel-metal hydride) batteries as an alternative. In the auto mode the AA alkaline batteries can power the AX500 for up to 180 shots while the Ni-MH batteries can last for up to an amazing 480 shots. All the captured images and the recorded videos are saved on the AX500’s memory medium which is in the form of an SD or an SDHC memory card. The transfer of saved files from the camera’s memory device to a PC or a laptop is done via its high-speed USB 2.0 digital interface. Performance The aperture control lets you adjust the amount of light that is allowed to fall on the image sensor, which in this Fujifilm camera ranges from f/3.3 to f/5.9. It also features an autofocus function with a range that spans from 45 cm (Wide) and 80 cm (Tele) to infinity. It also has a macro focus range of 10 cm - 80 cm on wide and 60 cm - 1 m on tele. The light sensitivity of this camera ranges from ISO 100 to 3200, giving you clear images irrespective of the available lighting conditions. The AX500 also features a wide range of adjustable shutter speeds that range from a maximum 1/1400 sec to a minimum of 8 sec. A built-in flash with auto and manual adjustment modes lets you control the intensity of the flash, with a range of 60 cm to 3 m (Wide) and 60 cm to 2 m (Tele). This when clubbed with Red Eye Reduction makes it possible to capture clear and sharp images even under low light. Features The intelligent auto scene mode identifies the scene you're shooting, be it portrait, landscape, night portrait, macro, or sport and automatically adjusts the camera's settings for optimum results. With 6 pre-set white balancing options to choose from, the AX500 lets you choose from a variety of image tone and temperature settings. This FinePix also sports a digital image stabilizer that makes sure that the captured images and videos are sharp and blur free. The AX500 also comes with face detection that automatically detects human faces within the frame, so that maximum priority is given to the clarity of the faces rather than other elements. The PictBridge technology lets you connect the camera directly to a printer without a PC, enabling easy and direct photo printing. The self-timer mode lets you delay the shutter release by 2 or 10 seconds, making this a very convenient option for self-portraits and group shots. The continuous mode lets the FinePix AX500 shoot at a maximum speed of 1.2 frames per second.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/u/h/fujifilm-finepix-ax500-point-shoot-400x400-imad8rgrefuqhetj.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/u/h/fujifilm-finepix-ax500-point-shoot-75x75-imad8rgrefuqhetj.jpeg","275x275":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/u/h/fujifilm-finepix-ax500-point-shoot-275x275-imad8rgrefuqhetj.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/u/h/fujifilm-finepix-ax500-point-shoot-125x125-imad8rgrefuqhetj.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/u/h/fujifilm-finepix-ax500-point-shoot-40x40-imad8rgrefuqhetj.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/u/h/fujifilm-finepix-ax500-point-shoot-100x100-imad8rgrefuqhetj.jpeg","200x200":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/u/h/fujifilm-finepix-ax500-point-shoot-200x200-imad8rgrefuqhetj.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/u/h/fujifilm-finepix-ax500-point-shoot-original-imad8rgrefuqhetj.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":5499.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":4299.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/fujifilm-finepix-ax500-point-shoot-camera/p/itmd8qv8yzafhhrd?pid=CAMD8QV8YKYNVFUH&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Fujifilm","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":21.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Black","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[CAMD9XW3DKA9AZMH,

HDC-TM80 Camcorder Camera","productDescription":"The compact Panasonic HDC-TM80 belongs to the Full HD series of camcorders from Panasonic. Ideal to take along on long trips or business meetings, this Full HD camcorder has a MOS image sensor that lets you take videos and images at 1.30 megapixel resolution at 16:9 aspect ratio. The HDC-TM80 is powered by the Crystal Engine PRO image processor, which produces smooth and high resolution videos and images. With the HDC-TM80, you can record videos in Full HD at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 dot pixels (50i). This camcorder records images in JPEG and videos in MPEG4-AVC. The built-in stereo microphone captures audio in 2 channel stereo and has a zoom microphone feature that captures original audio even when you zoom in while video-taping. The Panasonic video camera records audio while actively suppressing wind noise in outdoor shooting situations with the Wind Noise Canceler feature. The Panasonic Full HD camcorder has a HYBRID image stabilizer that combines optical and electric stabilization systems to ensure that your videos and images are blur-free even if your hands weren't steady when you shot them. Body This Panasonic video camera weighs 193 g and is very compact. Small enough to fit in a handbag, this camcorder is designed with easy-to-access buttons to make video recording convenient. The 2.7 inch rotating LCD touchscreen has a resolution of 230,400 dot pixels and can be used to compose beautifully framed videos or to preview them as well. The Full HD video camera has 16 GB built-in memory and can be expanded using SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards. The camcorder also comes with a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery. Performance This Panasonic camcorder has a Panasonic Lens with a focal length of 2.38 - 81 mm.

You can take sharp videos and images with the Manual and Auto Focus controls. The Panasonic camcorder has an aperture range of f/1.8 - 4. Aperture refers to the size of the lens opening which controls the amount of light falling on the image sensor. With the shutter speed range of 1/25 - 1/8000 second in Auto Slow Shutter On mode and 1.50 - 1/8000 second in Auto Slow Shutter Off mode, you can take dramatic images and videos of moving objects. Features & Connectivity The Panasonic Full HD camcorder has 11 preset scene modes like Fireworks, Beach, Sunset and many more. On Soft Skin mode, the video camera automatically detects skin tones in the frame and softens the focus in the area to increase skin beautifying effect. The Face Recognition function recognizes up to 6 pre-registered faces and optimizes settings to ensure they are in focus in the videos or images. With the Smile Shot feature, the HDC-TM80 automatically releases the shutter to capture a still image when it detects a smiling face in the frame. You can watch your Full HD videos on an HDTV by connecting the Panasonic camcorder with the HDMI mini-connector. You can also store your videos and images on PC or a laptop by transferring them through the USB 2.0 high speed port. With the AV Out port, you can watch your videos on a non HDTV as well. With the HD Writer AE 3.0 software that comes with this Panasonic video camera, you can edit and view your videos on a computer. You can also easily upload your videos and images to social networking sites as they are recorded and saved in YouTube and Facebook compatible formats.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/z/t/panasonic-tm80-camcorder-400x400-imaczg2rywu48ayw.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/z/t/panasonic-tm80-camcorder-75x75-imaczg2rywu48ayw.jpeg","275x275":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/z/t/panasonic-tm80-camcorder-275x275-imaczg2rywu48ayw.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/z/t/panasonic-tm80-camcorder-125x125-imaczg2rywu48ayw.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/z/t/panasonic-tm80-camcorder-40x40-imaczg2rywu48ayw.jpeg","100x100":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/z/t/panasonic-tm80-camcorder-100x100-imaczg2rywu48ayw.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/z/t/panasonic-tm80-camcorder-200x200-imaczg2rywu48ayw.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/z/t/panasonic-tm80-camcorder-original-imaczg2rywu48ayw.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":24990.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":21816.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/panasonic-hdc-tm80-camcorder-camera/p/itmczc2kfsqfbdrq?pid=CAMCYZHFP67QHQZT&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Panasonic","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":12.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Black","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAMDH9G7M5YF9S4B","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"JVC
