Apart from the type of disk, it is also featured with a high capacity 500 GB disk that can be used to store a lot of your favorite files and folders. Input Technology The Samsung system is equipped with a revolutionary keyboard design that helps it stand out against the body paneling. It is also incorporated with a high quality, intelligent touchpad that can recognize certain motions and gestures. The keyboard itself is incorporated with a host of additional smart functions that can be used to enhance your computing experience. You also have a functional number pad section. High Speed Data Crunching This laptop is equipped with the newest generation Pentium Dual Core processor chip. This third generation chip comes with a clock speed of 1.8 GHz that can be used to efficiently process enough data to deliver a seamless computing experience.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/computer/2/k/d/samsung-notebook-400x400-imadk7qaqyr63vzg.jpeg","275x275":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/2/k/d/samsung-notebook-275x275-imadk7qaqyr63vzg.jpeg","75x75":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/computer/2/k/d/samsung-notebook-75x75-imadk7qaqyr63vzg.jpeg","125x125":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/2/k/d/samsung-notebook-125x125-imadk7qaqyr63vzg.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/computer/2/k/d/samsung-notebook-40x40-imadk7qaqyr63vzg.jpeg","1100x1100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/2/k/d/samsung-notebook-1100x1100-imadk7qaqyr63vzg.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/2/k/d/samsung-notebook-100x100-imadk7qaqyr63vzg.jpeg","200x200":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/computer/2/k/d/samsung-notebook-200x200-imadk7qaqyr63vzg.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/computer/2/k/d/samsung-notebook-original-imadk7qaqyr63vzg.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":24990.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":24500.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/samsung-np300e5v-a03in-laptop-3rd-gen-pdc-2gb-500gb-dos/p/itmdk6yb5ghbgfhc?pid=COMDK6Y9DWEZB2KD&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"SAMSUNG","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":1.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"SLeek
