It brings you as close to the action as you need to be and ensures that every image is as clear and crisp as you remember them. To create a higher zoom rate, weve used additional pixels from the image sensor to the existing optical zoom. The increased number of pixels allows for clearer shots without any blurring, even from long distances. Now you can capture the details of every emotion from your childs football game without even having to be on the field.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/y/b/samsung-smx-f50bp-camcorder-400x400-imacyb8fzgqgesd4.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/y/b/samsung-smx-f50bp-camcorder-75x75-imacyb8fzgqgesd4.jpeg","275x275":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/y/b/samsung-smx-f50bp-camcorder-275x275-imacyb8fzgqgesd4.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/y/b/samsung-smx-f50bp-camcorder-125x125-imacyb8fzgqgesd4.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/y/b/samsung-smx-f50bp-camcorder-40x40-imacyb8fzgqgesd4.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/y/b/samsung-smx-f50bp-camcorder-100x100-imacyb8fzgqgesd4.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/y/b/samsung-smx-f50bp-camcorder-200x200-imacyb8fzgqgesd4.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/f/y/b/samsung-smx-f50bp-camcorder-original-imacyb8fzgqgesd4.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":13990.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":11371.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/samsung-smx-f50bp-camcorder-camera/p/itmczc4squh82rvf?pid=CAMCXNWTZ7BNZFYB&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Samsung","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":18.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Black","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAMDTQYFVZPDUU7E","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Pentax K 30 Body Only DSLR Camera","productDescription":null,"imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/u/7/e/pentax-k-30-body-only-slr-400x400-imadu4t3bhqrcqxh.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/u/7/e/pentax-k-30-body-only-slr-75x75-imadu4t3bhqrcqxh.jpeg","275x275":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/u/7/e/pentax-k-30-body-only-slr-275x275-imadu4t3bhqrcqxh.jpeg","125x125":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/u/7/e/pentax-k-30-body-only-slr-125x125-imadu4t3bhqrcqxh.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/u/7/e/pentax-k-30-body-only-slr-40x40-imadu4t3bhqrcqxh.jpeg","1100x1100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/u/7/e/pentax-k-30-body-only-slr-1100x1100-imadu4t3bhqrcqxh.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/u/7/e/pentax-k-30-body-only-slr-100x100-imadu4t3bhqrcqxh.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/u/7/e/pentax-k-30-body-only-slr-200x200-imadu4t3bhqrcqxh.jpeg","unknown":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/u/7/e/pentax-k-30-body-only-slr-original-imadu4t3bhqrcqxh.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":26795.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":24116.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/pentax-k-30-body-only-dslr-camera/p/itmdtqy2nsegcevj?pid=CAMDTQYFVZPDUU7E&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Pentax","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":9.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAMCVYDJ6NXTPTEN","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Canon EOS 500D DSLR Camera","productDescription":"Capture your story in stunning detail with the EOS 550D.

FinePix JX300 Point & Shoot Camera","productDescription":"Style and ease-of-use now come wrapped in one small package with this new camera. The Fujifilm FinePix JX300 is a versatile little camera with many features that simplify photography. From the Simple and Stylish series of cameras from Fujifilm, this digital camera is ideal for the style-conscious and first-time photographer. The JX300 features a Fujinon lens with a focal length of 5 - 25 mm and a 35 mm equivalent focal length of 28 - 140 mm. Don’t worship your favorite rock stars from a distance any more.  The FinePix point and shoot can zoom up to 5x in optical zoom and up to 6.7x in digital zoom, working tirelessly to bring your subjects closer for detailed shots. The JX300 also features a CCD image sensor that enhances you 14 megapixel resolution images. This trendy little camera is stylish, fitting in with any setting. The minimal controls and buttons on the back panel also make it easy-to-use. The FinePix JX300 weighs 130 g and slips easily into your pocket or bag. Shoot magnificent videos with the HD video support feature that shoots at 1280 x 720 dot pixel resolution and 30 fps. You can also preview and compose your videos and photographs on the 2.7 inch TFT LCD screen, which has a resolution of 230,000 dot pixels. Battery and Storage The Fujifilm JX300 saves images on SD or SDHC memory cards. You can transfer images and videos from your camera to a computer or PC using the USB 2.0 high speed port available in the FinePix digital camera. The FinePix camera is powered by a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery. Performance The Fujifilm JX300 has an aperture range of f/2.6 - 6.2. Aperture refers to the size of the opening in the lens, which controls that amount of light falling on the image sensor. The Auto focus has a range of 45 cm onwards (Wide) and 80 cm to infinity (Tele), focusing in this range automatically to deliver sharp images every time. This FinePix digital camera has a light sensitivity of ISO 100 - 3200, indicating that images taken even in the dark have reduced noise or grains. The camera also features a shutter speed range of 1/1800 - 1/4 sec, which can be reduced to 8 seconds in some modes. This lets you take defined images of moving objects. Also use the built-in flash, which has a range of 40 cm - 3 m (Wide) and 80 cm - 2 m (Tele), to light up every detail of your friends and family. Features The Fujifilm JX300 features 15 shooting modes like Sport, Night, Sunset, Snow mode and more. In Sport mode, the camera identifies extremely fast moving objects and increases the shutter speed to capture stunning images. The digital image stabilizer ensures your images are blur-free and sharp.  The face detection feature can automatically identify faces in a frame and optimize focus and exposure settings in order to keep them in the foreground. With the Blink Detection feature, the camera will warn you that a person in the photo has blinked, letting you snap another photo to replace the old one. When a smile is detected in the frame, the Smile and Shoot mode captures an image instantly, preserving those perfect moments for posterity. You can now join your family and friends in every photograph with the self-timer, which delays shutter release by 2 or 10 seconds. This gives you enough time to get in front of the lens, instead of stay behind it. With the Continuous Shooting mode, you can photograph every adorable moment at 1.2 frames per second to chronicle a performance or a sport in its entirety.  So use the Fujifilm FinePix JX300 to not only earn social mileage, but to ensure the special moments of your life are recorded in high resolution.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/6/7/f/fujifilm-jx300-point-shoot-400x400-imacyb67gj9znacb.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/6/7/f/fujifilm-jx300-point-shoot-75x75-imacyb67gj9znacb.jpeg","275x275":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/6/7/f/fujifilm-jx300-point-shoot-275x275-imacyb67gj9znacb.jpeg","125x125":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/6/7/f/fujifilm-jx300-point-shoot-125x125-imacyb67gj9znacb.jpeg","40x40":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/6/7/f/fujifilm-jx300-point-shoot-40x40-imacyb67gj9znacb.jpeg","100x100":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/6/7/f/fujifilm-jx300-point-shoot-100x100-imacyb67gj9znacb.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/6/7/f/fujifilm-jx300-point-shoot-200x200-imacyb67gj9znacb.jpeg","unknown":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/6/7/f/fujifilm-jx300-point-shoot-original-imacyb67gj9znacb.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":7499.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":5895.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/fujifilm-finepix-jx300-point-shoot-camera/p/itmczctafqzxbhqu?pid=CAMCXNWTGW3GH67F&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Fujifilm","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":21.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Black","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[CAMCZR55KPDXVXY9,

Like the DMC-FS15, the DMC-FS7 also include a newly-added independent iA button on top of the camera that lets the user enter directly into the mode without going into the menu.Other features of the FS7 include a Venus Engine IV processor, which enables an advanced processing system and quick response times. An intelligent LCD screen detects light conditions and automatically adjusts the brightness levels for viewing in sunlight and helps to preserve battery life.

The 1D Mark IV retains its predecessors'form factor and 1.3x crop, APS-H sensor size, but this time increases its pixel count to a whopping 16MP. This may not seem like many in the era of 25MP full-frame DSLRs and 14MP compacts, but it's a lot when you consider the Mark IV still has the ability to shoot at 10 frames per second. If you consider that this is almost the same resolution as offered by the last generation of Canon's studio-targeted camera, the 1Ds Mark II, but with the ability to shoot twice as fast, then you start to appreciate what this camera is promising to do. In our tests it proved that Canon has left the autofocus problems that plagued the Mark III well and truly behind it, and while the Mark IV isn't the best high ISO camera on the market, it's still an exceptionally good one. From the point-of-view of the tasks it was built to tackle (high speed sports), there is nothing that can touch the detailed, high resolution images that it can deliver ten times a second.","imageUrls":{},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":259995.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":252195.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/canon-d5200-body-only-dslr-camera/p/itmdv58fz2sdg6hm?pid=CAMDYVEVXY2PVWUR&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Canon","inStock":false,"codAvailable":false,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":3.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Black","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAMDTZYVNFH3MVDS","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Pentax K 5 II Single(DA 18-55 mm WR) Lens DSLR Camera","productDescription":null,"imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/v/d/s/pentax-k-5-ii-single-da-18-55-mm-wr-lens-slr-400x400-imadtqdargzbjjzq.jpeg","275x275":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/v/d/s/pentax-k-5-ii-single-da-18-55-mm-wr-lens-slr-275x275-imadtqdargzbjjzq.jpeg","75x75":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/v/d/s/pentax-k-5-ii-single-da-18-55-mm-wr-lens-slr-75x75-imadtqdargzbjjzq.jpeg","125x125":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/v/d/s/pentax-k-5-ii-single-da-18-55-mm-wr-lens-slr-125x125-imadtqdargzbjjzq.jpeg","40x40":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/v/d/s/pentax-k-5-ii-single-da-18-55-mm-wr-lens-slr-40x40-imadtqdargzbjjzq.jpeg","100x100":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/v/d/s/pentax-k-5-ii-single-da-18-55-mm-wr-lens-slr-100x100-imadtqdargzbjjzq.jpeg","200x200":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/v/d/s/pentax-k-5-ii-single-da-18-55-mm-wr-lens-slr-200x200-imadtqdargzbjjzq.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/v/d/s/pentax-k-5-ii-single-da-18-55-mm-wr-lens-slr-original-imadtqdargzbjjzq.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":84995.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":76496.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/pentax-k-5-ii-single-da-18-55-mm-wr-lens-dslr-camera/p/itmdtzzhfmff7zmh?pid=CAMDTZYVNFH3MVDS&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Pentax","inStock":true,"codAvailable":false,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":9.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAME44G2EH4W8QQV","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Nikon Coolpix L32 Point & Shoot Camera","productDescription":null,"imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/q/v/nikon-coolpix-l32-point-shoot-400x400-imae44pfrygsxfh3.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/q/v/nikon-coolpix-l32-point-shoot-75x75-imae44pfrygsxfh3.jpeg","275x275":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/q/v/nikon-coolpix-l32-point-shoot-275x275-imae44pfrygsxfh3.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/q/v/nikon-coolpix-l32-point-shoot-125x125-imae44pfrygsxfh3.jpeg","40x40":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/q/v/nikon-coolpix-l32-point-shoot-40x40-imae44pfrygsxfh3.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/q/v/nikon-coolpix-l32-point-shoot-100x100-imae44pfrygsxfh3.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/q/v/nikon-coolpix-l32-point-shoot-200x200-imae44pfrygsxfh3.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/camera/q/q/v/nikon-coolpix-l32-point-shoot-original-imae44pfrygsxfh3.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":0.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":0.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/nikon-coolpix-l32-point-shoot-camera/p/itme44g6xtwwkthy?pid=CAME44G2EH4W8QQV&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Nikon","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":0.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Silver","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[CAME44G2PKFZVRRS, CAME44G2YKVH87V6]","colorVariants":"[CAME44G2PKFZVRRS, CAME44G2YKVH87V6]","styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAMD3A6AJN4YJ2YG","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Panasonic HX-DC1","productDescription":"The Panasonic HX-DC1 is one of the distinctive camcorders in the market today.

Tough-6020","productDescription":"The Tough 6020 is an extraordinary one-off type digital camera from Olympus which comes loaded with a multitude of amazing features and functions. With a purpose-built body, this Olympus is designed to be waterproof, shockproof and freeze proof. This combination of high quality and extreme durability makes the Tough-6020 the perfect choice for outdoor enthusiasts and adventures. This camera allows the photographer to concentrate on capturing high quality images rather than lookout for the safety of the camera. With a focal length of 28 mm – 140 mm, the Olympus 6020 features a 5x optical zoom along with an additional 5x of digital zoom for increased magnification. This camera sports a CCD image sensor that gives it the capability of capturing high quality images at 12.7 megapixel resolution. The Olympus 6020 comes with an environmentally sealed body design that protects the camera from adverse and rough conditions. With all the high-tech features and the ultra-durable body, this camera still manages to weigh a modest 178 g. This compact camera is also capable of recording HD videos at 1280 x 720 pixel resolution. The captured images and videos can be viewed on a 2.7 inch LCD screen that has a 230,000 dot pixel resolution. Battery and Storage Capable of high quality image and video recording, this Olympus digital camera comes with an inbuilt memory of 2 GB out of which 1.6 GB can be used for storage. Apart from this internal memory, the camera comes with further memory expansion in the form of an SD memory card slot that supports SD or SDHC memory cards. Powered by a LI-50B rechargeable lithium-ion battery, the Tough 6020 also features external connectivity options in the form of a high-speed USB port and an HDMI port. Performance The Aperture control on the Olympus Tough 6020 lets you adjust the amount of light that passes through the lens of the camera. The aperture control on this compact digital camera has a range of f/3.9 - f/5.9. This camera has the auto focus function that uses the TTL or through the lens contrast detection technology. The light sensitivity of the camera ranges from ISO 64 to 1600, letting you take clear images even in insufficient lighting conditions. The camera also features a wide range of adjustable shutter speeds that ranges from a maximum of 1/2000 sec to a minimum of 4 sec.

Features The Olympus Tough 6020 comes with a wide range of pre-set scene modes that allow for trouble-free image capture even in certain unfavourable conditions. These scene modes includes the likes of portrait, landscape, night-scene, underwater, underwater macro and more. The presence of an intelligent sensor shift image stabilization technology helps to make sure that the captured images and recorded videos are sharp and shake free. The face detection technology on the Olympus Tough 6020 lets it identify the location of human faces within the frame and concentrate the lighting and focus on the human faces. This gives more importance to the faces rather than on unimportant elements that may be present within the frame. The Red Eye Reduction feature helps reduce the red eye effect that is most commonly caused by close range flash. Adding to the list of useful features is the white balancing, which has 6 types of pre-set adjustments to choose from in the manual mode. The self-timer function on this camera lets you delay the shutter release by 2 or 10 seconds, giving you the opportunity to be able to be the photographer and at the same time be in the picture as well. Continuous mode is a useful feature that lets the Tough 6020 take a series of shots over a very short period of time, which in this case is up to 5 shots per second.

PL20","productDescription":"As a perfect tool to help you effortlessly capture and hold on to those fond memories is the entry-level PL20 point and shoot digital camera from Samsung. With its collection of smart functions and creative features, this very capable compact and affordable camera with its ability to capture high quality images in a variety of shooting modes is perfect for everyday use. Featuring a Samsung wide angle lens with a focal length of 4.9 -24.5 mm or a 35 mm equivalent of 27 – 135 mm, the PL20 is capable of a very useful 5x optical zoom. This zooming ability combines well with the camera’s CCD Image Sensor that lets you capture images at an amazing 14.2 megapixels. Sporting a sleek and sturdy design, the Samsung PL20 has an extremely lightweight body that weighs only 103 g excluding the battery and memory card. This reduced weight and compact body helps make the PL20 a highly portable digital camera that is easy to carry around on all your travels and special occasions. This very simplistic point and shoot camera not only has the ability to capture high quality images, but also the ability to record HD 720p videos with or without an audio track. These recorded images and videos can be viewed on the PL20’s 2.7 inch TFT LCD screen that possesses a display resolution of 230,000 dots. Since the Samsung PL20 doesn’t feature an optical viewfinder, this 2.7 inch LCD display acts as its live viewfinder while operating in the shooting mode. Battery and Storage The PL20 gets its operational power from a Samsung BP-70A rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which powers the camera up to 220 shots on a single full charge. These captured images are saved in the JPEG (DCF) format while the videos are recorded in the AVI(MJPEG) file format. The saved media files are stored on the camera’s memory device which is in the form of an SD, SDHC or SDXC memory card. These files on the memory card can easily be transferred to an external device like a PC or a laptop by using the camera’s high-speed USB digital interface. The presence of an AV out with user selectable PAL or NTSC output signals lets you connect directly and view all your images and videos on a standard definition television. Performance The aperture refers to the size of the opening in the lens which controls the amount of light that falls on the image sensor, which on the PL20 ranges from f/3.5 - f/5.9.

SH100 Point & Shoot Camera","productDescription":"The powerful and versatile SH100 from Samsung features a wide range of advanced imaging technologies, making it a perfect tool for those looking to advance from an entry level to a highly advanced point and shoot digital camera. This mid-level, high performance point and shoot from Samsung features a focal length of 4.7 – 23.5 mm which is a 35 mm equivalent of 26 – 130 mm. This 26 mm Samsung wide-angle lens provides the camera with 5x optical zoom capability with an additional 5x digital zoom in the still mode and 14.4 x while on the play mode. The SH100’s powerful CCD image sensor gives it an optical sensor resolution of 14.2 megapixels. Sporting a stylish and compact camera shell design that weighs only 110.2 g, this Wi-Fi enabled Samsung SH100 becomes increasingly portable and easy to carry along with you on all your travels and get-togethers. The camera’s highly capable CCD image sensor and the 14.2 megapixel resolution give it the ability to record HD 720p videos with mono audio. The Samsung SH100 sports a 3 inch TFT LCD Touch Screen Panel with a very commendable image display resolution of 230,000 dots, which lets you instantly view all the captured files in high quality. This 3 inch resistive touch screen holds all the camera’s menu and navigational controls while also filling in as a live viewfinder as the SH100 doesn’t feature an optical viewfinder. Battery and Storage Powered by a BP85A rechargeable lithium-ion battery, the camera stores all the captured images and recorded videos in its memory device which can be accessed through a memory card slot. This memory card slot is compatible with an Micro SD card expandable up to 2 GB or a Micro SDHC card which is upgradable up to 8 GB memory. The camera features an analog video out that is both PAL and NTSC compatible, giving you the opportunity to enjoy high quality images and videos on your standard definition TV. The transfer of saved files from the camera’s memory device to a PC or a laptop is done via its high-speed USB 2.0 digital interface. The presence of Wi-Fi connectivity further lets the camera wirelessly connect and share its media files with other Wi-Fi enabled multimedia storage devices.

The Samsung lens on this digital camera features an autofocus function with a overall focusing range of 5 cm (Wide) and 100 cm (Tele) to infinity. It further has a macro focus capability which ranges from 5 cm – 80 cm (Wide) and 100 cm – 150 cm (Tele). This gives the photographer greater focussing depth for extreme close-up or wide open landscape shots. The light sensitivity or ISO speed on this Samsung point and shoot is from ISO 80 to ISO 3200. This ISO speed combines well with the camera’s variable shutter speeds which has a highest of 1/2000 sec and a lowest of 8 sec to give the camera a greater low light operational capability. The camera also features a built-in flash unit that has an operational range of 0.2 m – 3.2 m (Wide) and 0.5 m - 1.8 m (Tele) on auto ISO. Features This camera features Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) technology that enables sharing of digital media files between devices such as computers, printers, cameras, cell phones and other multimedia devices. With a number of pre-set shooting modes that include Smart Auto, Program, Night Shot, Close-up and Smart Movie, the SH100 lets you capture perfect images with tailor made settings to work in very particular situations or conditions. Working with digital image stabilization technology, the SH100 can make sure that all the images and videos that are captures appear clear, steady and blur free. With a single touch control, the Samsung SH100 records 720p HD videos at 30 fps with mono audio that is picked up by the camera’s built-in microphone. The advent of the PictBridge feature lets you to connect the camera directly to a printer without a PC, enabling easy direct photo printing. The SH100 comes with Red Eye Reduction and Face Detection, which together automatically detects focuses and prioritises the clarity of human faces that are present within the image frame, resulting in clear and undisturbed images, irrespective of the available light. This along with a 2 or 10 second self-timer function gives the photographer a great deal of convenience for self-portraits and group shots.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/camera/s/w/d/samsung-sh-series-sh100-point-shoot-400x400-imadfz2dtjdn7x9s.jpeg","275x275":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/camera/s/w/d/samsung-sh-series-sh100-point-shoot-275x275-imadfz2dtjdn7x9s.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/camera/s/w/d/samsung-sh-series-sh100-point-shoot-75x75-imadfz2dtjdn7x9s.jpeg","125x125":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/camera/s/w/d/samsung-sh-series-sh100-point-shoot-125x125-imadfz2dtjdn7x9s.jpeg","40x40":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/camera/s/w/d/samsung-sh-series-sh100-point-shoot-40x40-imadfz2dtjdn7x9s.jpeg","100x100":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/camera/s/w/d/samsung-sh-series-sh100-point-shoot-100x100-imadfz2dtjdn7x9s.jpeg","200x200":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/camera/s/w/d/samsung-sh-series-sh100-point-shoot-200x200-imadfz2dtjdn7x9s.jpeg","7x9":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/camera/s/w/d/samsung-sh-series-sh100-point-shoot-original-imadfz2dtjdn7x9s.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":14900.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":12510.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/samsung-sh100-point-shoot-camera/p/itmczc4spe6zshzd?pid=CAMCWHN8UDUGYSWD&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Samsung","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":16.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Black","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[]","colorVariants":null,"styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAMDFYFE57HNQQNG","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP1 Point & Shoot Camera","productDescription":"The DMC-FP1 features a 4x optical zoom LUMIX DC VARIO lens (35mm camera equivalent: 35-140mm).

The Fujifilm compact camera can automatically adjust ISO sensitivity between ISO 100 - 320. Higher ISO settings enable you to shoot photographs in low lighting conditions.

With key features like a wide-angle lens and optical zoom, this Samsung point and shoot camera is perfectly suited for those looking to capture expansive landscapes, group shots or even experiment with some close-up and macro photography. The ultra-wide 27 mm lens boasts a focal length of 4.8 - 19.2 mm or a 35 mm equivalent of 27 - 108 mm. This gives the Samsung digital camera a considerable optical zoom capacity of 4x along with an additional digital zoom of 3x on the still image mode and 12.5x on the play mode. Operating a highly capable CCD image sensor, the ES9 has a commendable 12.2 megapixel optical sensor resolution. The ES series digital camera from Samsung sports a simple and compact design that manages to weigh only 117 g, without the battery and memory card. This combination of a user-friendly and lightweight design gives the Samsung ES9 comfortable handling and easy portability. All the images and video captures on by this camera can be viewed on its 2.36 inch TFT LCD screen that has a 110,000 dot display resolution. This LCD screen is also used as a live viewfinder as the ES9 doesn’t feature an optical viewfinder. Battery and Storage The power supply for this Samsung camera comes in the form of AA alkaline batteries, letting you capture your desired images and videos. These captured files are stored on the camera’s memory storage device which is in the form of an SD card expandable up to 2 GB or an SDHC card with up to 8 GB of expansion. The ES9’s compatibility with both Windows and Mac operating systems makes it very easy to transfer the files from the camera to a PC or a laptop using the camera’s high-speed USB digital interface. Performance The aperture control provides the user with the ability to adjust the amount of light that passes through the lens, which on this camera has a range of f/2.9 (Wide) – f/6.5 (Tele). The ES9 also features a TTL or through the lens autofocus system that has a normal focusing range of 80 cm – infinity. It also has a macro focus range of 10  – 80 cm (Wide) and 60 - 80cm (Tele), giving you the opportunity to capture a variety of close-up and long-range shots. The ISO speed or light sensitivity controls the amount of light that falls on the image sensor, which on the Samsung ES9 starts at ISO 80 and goes up to ISO 1600. The available shutter speeds on this digital camera has a shortest duration of 1/2000 sec and a longest open shutter duration of 8 sec. The combination of the ISO speed and the shutter speed provides the user with a wide variety of settings that enables the capture of clear images even under insufficient light. Furthering the camera’s low light shooting capability is the advent of a built-in flash unit that features an operational range of 0.4 – 3 m (Wide) and 0.5 – 2 m (Tele). Features Featuring a wide range of pre-set shooting modes and white balancing modes ,the ES9 is capable of working perfectly in very specific conditions. The presence of a digital image stabilizer helps capture sharp and blur-free images and videos. The combination of a powerful image sensor and a superior 12.2 megapixel resolution gives this camera the ability to record videos with 640 x 480 resolution at 30 fps along with mono audio. The presence of an AV out port lets the camera transmit in both PAL and NTSC output signals. The available PictBridge function allows you to connect the camera directly to a printer without a PC, enabling easy direct photo printing. The camera also features Face Detection and Red Eye Reduction which helps to automatically find, focus and maximize the clarity of the human faces present within the image frame. A self-timer function  on this camera gives the user a 2 or 10 sec delay between pressing the image capture button and the actual shutter release. This gives the photographer enough time to experiment  with a variety of shooting styles, especially for group and self-portraits, making the Samsung ES9 a great and affordable tool for an all-round photography experience.","imageUrls":{"400x400":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/camera/f/t/y/samsung-es9-point-shoot-400x400-imad6qhf2kq9mdjk.jpeg","275x275":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/camera/f/t/y/samsung-es9-point-shoot-275x275-imad6qhf2kq9mdjk.jpeg","75x75":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/camera/f/t/y/samsung-es9-point-shoot-75x75-imad6qhf2kq9mdjk.jpeg","125x125":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/camera/f/t/y/samsung-es9-point-shoot-125x125-imad6qhf2kq9mdjk.jpeg","40x40":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/camera/f/t/y/samsung-es9-point-shoot-40x40-imad6qhf2kq9mdjk.jpeg","100x100":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/camera/f/t/y/samsung-es9-point-shoot-100x100-imad6qhf2kq9mdjk.jpeg","200x200":"http://img6a.flixcart.com//image/camera/f/t/y/samsung-es9-point-shoot-200x200-imad6qhf2kq9mdjk.jpeg","unknown":"http://img5a.flixcart.com//image/camera/f/t/y/samsung-es9-point-shoot-original-imad6qhf2kq9mdjk.jpeg"},"maximumRetailPrice":{"amount":4400.0,"currency":"INR"},"sellingPrice":{"amount":3780.0,"currency":"INR"},"productUrl":"http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/samsung-es9-point-shoot-camera/p/itmd6qhdq9f9jbzc?pid=CAMD6QHCSCAYXFTY&affid=rajeshmee","productBrand":"Samsung","inStock":false,"codAvailable":true,"emiAvailable":null,"discountPercentage":14.0,"cashBack":null,"offers":[],"size":null,"color":"Black","sizeUnit":"","sizeVariants":"[CAMD6SG46HRZQZRH, CAMD6SG4REEZYY6V]","colorVariants":"[CAMD6SG46HRZQZRH, CAMD6SG4REEZYY6V]","styleCode":null}},"productShippingBaseInfo":{"shippingOptions":null},"offset":null},{"productBaseInfo":{"productIdentifier":{"productId":"CAMCVYGC8YZQ8RM7","categoryPaths":{"categoryPath":[[{"title":"Electronics>Cameras"}]]}},"productAttributes":{"title":"Sony DCR-SX63E Camcorder Camera","productDescription":"With Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 60x optical zoom lens for capturing extremely tight shots, even from far away.
